## ⚡ Fastest Path to Implementation

### Step 1: Read This (2 minutes)

You have **4 essential files** for Claude Code:

1. **SPECIFICATION.md** - What to build
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - How to build it  
3. **TASKS.md** - Step-by-step plan
4. **CONTEXT.md** - Quick reference

### Step 2: Prerequisites (30 minutes one-time)

**Install on your Windows machine**:
```
✅ .NET 9.0 SDK - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0
✅ CUDA Toolkit 12.x - https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
✅ Claude Code - Already installed (you mentioned this)
```

### Step 3: Copy Files (1 minute)

**Copy these 4 files to your project directory**:
```
C:\YourProjects\VocalFold\
  ├─ SPECIFICATION.md
  ├─ ARCHITECTURE.md
  ├─ TASKS.md
  └─ CONTEXT.md
```

### Step 4: Start Claude Code (30 seconds)

```bash
cd C:\YourProjects\VocalFold
claude
```

### Step 5: First Prompt to Claude Code

Copy-paste this exactly:

```
Hi! I want to implement the Voice-to-Text application defined in this project.

Please read these files in order:
1. SPECIFICATION.md (requirements)
2. ARCHITECTURE.md (technical design)
3. TASKS.md (implementation plan)
4. CONTEXT.md (quick reference)

After reading, start with Task 1.1 from TASKS.md: "Initialize F# Project"

Let me know when you're ready to begin.
```

### Step 6: Follow Along (4-5 hours)

Claude Code will:
- ✅ Create F# project
- ✅ Add dependencies
- ✅ Implement each module
- ✅ Ask you to test checkpoints
- ✅ Build final .exe

You will:
- ✅ Confirm each checkpoint works
- ✅ Report any errors
- ✅ Test the final application

## 💡 Quick Tips

### For Claude Code:
1. **Be specific**: "Implement Task 2.1" not "Add audio"
2. **Reference docs**: "According to ARCHITECTURE.md..."
3. **Test each step**: Don't skip checkpoints
4. **Update progress**: Tell Claude what worked/didn't work

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- ❌ Don't skip reading the 4 core files
- ❌ Don't let Claude use Python instead of F#
- ❌ Don't skip testing between tasks
- ❌ Don't forget to install prerequisites

---

## 🚨 Prerequisites Check

Before starting, verify:

```bash
# Check .NET
dotnet --version
# Should show: 9.0.x

# Check CUDA (if you have NVIDIA GPU)
nvcc --version
# Should show: Cuda compilation tools, release 12.x

# Check Claude Code
claude --version
# Should work
```

If any fail, install them first!

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I start without reading everything?**  
A: Yes! Just read SPECIFICATION.md and start. But CLAUDE_CODE_WORKFLOW.md will save you time.

**Q: What if Claude Code suggests Python?**  
A: Stop it immediately. Say "We must use F# according to SPECIFICATION.md"

**Q: What if something doesn't work?**  
A: Check TROUBLESHOOTING.md first, then tell Claude Code the exact error.

**Q: Can I customize it?**  
A: Yes! See DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md after implementation.

**Q: Do I need GPU?**  
A: Recommended for speed. Will work on CPU but 10x slower.

## ✨ Why This Works

Traditional approach:
```
You describe → Claude guesses tech → Wrong choice → Start over
```

This approach:
```
You provide specs → Claude follows → Right tech → Success!
```

**Time saved**: 2-3 hours  
**Quality improvement**: Much higher  
**Frustration**: Much lower
