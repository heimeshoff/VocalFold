# Methodology Comparison for This Project

## Project Scope Analysis

**Project Type**: Self-contained desktop utility  
**Complexity**: Medium (5 modules, 1 main app)  
**Team Size**: Solo developer  
**Timeline**: 4-6 hours implementation  
**Claude Code Usage**: Primary development tool  

---

## Methodology Comparison

### 1. Our Recommended Approach ⭐

**Structure**:
```
SPECIFICATION.md    (What to build)
ARCHITECTURE.md     (How to build it)
TASKS.md           (Step-by-step plan)
CONTEXT.md         (Session continuity)
```

**Strengths for this project**:
- ✅ **Right-sized**: Not over-engineered for 4-6 hour project
- ✅ **Claude Code optimized**: Clear context, explicit constraints
- ✅ **Resumable**: Easy to pick up in new session
- ✅ **Technology-locked**: Prevents wrong choices (e.g., Python vs F#)
- ✅ **Quality gates**: Test after each module
- ✅ **Clear scope**: What's in, what's out

**Best for**:
- Solo developers
- Medium complexity
- First-time Claude Code projects
- Need to resume across sessions
- Want reproducible results

---

### 2. PRD-Only Method

**Structure**:
```
PRD.md (Product Requirements Document)
```

**How it works**:
- Single document with requirements
- Claude makes all technical decisions
- Implementation details emerge during development

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Fast to set up
- ✅ Good for exploration
- ✅ Product-focused

**Weaknesses for this project**:
- ❌ Claude might choose Python over F#
- ❌ No module structure guidance
- ❌ Technology stack unclear
- ❌ Hard to ensure consistency across sessions
- ❌ Claude might over-engineer or under-engineer

**When to use instead**:
- Exploratory projects
- Technology stack doesn't matter
- You want Claude to propose solutions
- Small project (<2 hours)

**Verdict**: ❌ Not ideal for this project - too much ambiguity

---

### 3. Spec-Driven Development

**Structure**:
```
SPEC.md (Detailed technical specification)
```

**How it works**:
- Very detailed technical specification
- Every function signature defined
- Every module interface documented
- Implementation is "just" coding to spec

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Very precise
- ✅ Great for large teams
- ✅ Testable requirements

**Weaknesses for this project**:
- ❌ Over-specification for 4-6 hour project
- ❌ Takes too long to write spec
- ❌ Rigid - hard to adapt during implementation
- ❌ No task breakdown for Claude Code

**When to use instead**:
- Large projects (weeks/months)
- Multiple developers
- Contract work with strict deliverables
- Safety-critical systems

**Verdict**: ❌ Overkill for this project scope

---

### 4. Milestones/Epic-Based Method

**Structure**:
```
README.md
MILESTONES.md (or EPICS.md)
```

**How it works**:
- High-level milestones/epics
- Each milestone is a feature or phase
- Tasks emerge during implementation

**Example milestones**:
1. Hotkey detection working
2. Audio recording working
3. Whisper.NET integration complete
4. End-to-end demo working

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Good for agile development
- ✅ Flexible
- ✅ Progress tracking built-in

**Weaknesses for this project**:
- ❌ No technical constraints documented
- ❌ Claude might go off-track between milestones
- ❌ Technology choices not explicit
- ❌ Module interfaces not defined

**When to use instead**:
- Ongoing projects with frequent pivots
- When scope is evolving
- Multiple sprints planned

**Verdict**: ⚠️ Could work but needs more structure for Claude Code

---

### 5. BMAD Method (Unknown - Best Guess)

**If BMAD = "Build, Measure, Analyze, Deploy"** (DevOps cycle):

**Structure**:
```
BUILD.md (How to build)
MEASURE.md (Metrics to track)
ANALYZE.md (Performance analysis)  
DEPLOY.md (Deployment guide)
```

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Good for production systems
- ✅ Emphasizes metrics
- ✅ Deployment-focused

**Weaknesses for this project**:
- ❌ More about operations than development
- ❌ Doesn't help Claude Code with implementation
- ❌ Missing requirements and architecture
- ❌ Overhead for desktop utility

**When to use instead**:
- Production web services
- Need monitoring/alerting
- DevOps focus

**Verdict**: ❌ Wrong focus for this project

---

### 6. Superpowers/Skills Method

**Structure**:
```
SKILLS.md (What skills/tools Claude can use)
POWERS.md (What capabilities to leverage)
```

**How it works**:
- Documents available tools/libraries
- Defines what Claude can assume it has access to
- Like MCP tools but documented

**Example**:
```markdown
# Available Skills
- File system access
- Terminal commands
- F# compilation
- NuGet package management
```

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Clear capability boundaries
- ✅ Good for tool-heavy projects
- ✅ Prevents Claude from suggesting unavailable tools

**Weaknesses for this project**:
- ❌ Doesn't provide requirements
- ❌ Doesn't provide architecture  
- ❌ No implementation roadmap
- ❌ Just defines what's possible, not what to build

**When to use instead**:
- Complex tool integrations
- Many external services
- API-heavy projects
- Unclear what tools are available

**Verdict**: ⚠️ Good supplement, not sufficient alone

## Hybrid Approaches

### Our Recommendation Explained

We're actually using a **hybrid approach**:

```
SPECIFICATION.md    ← Product focus (like PRD)
ARCHITECTURE.md     ← Technical focus (like Spec-driven)
TASKS.md           ← Execution focus (like Milestones)
CONTEXT.md         ← Session continuity (unique)
```

**Why this combination wins**:

1. **SPECIFICATION.md gives product clarity**:
   - What to build (PRD-style)
   - Success criteria
   - Scope boundaries

2. **ARCHITECTURE.md gives technical guardrails**:
   - Technology stack locked in
   - Module interfaces defined
   - Design decisions documented

3. **TASKS.md gives Claude Code a roadmap**:
   - Step-by-step plan
   - Testable checkpoints
   - Clear order of operations

4. **CONTEXT.md enables session continuity**:
   - Quick reference
   - Progress tracking
   - Common pitfalls

└─ NO  → Continue

Do you know the exact tech stack?
├─ NO  → PRD + let Claude explore
└─ YES → Continue

Do you need to resume across sessions?
├─ NO  → Milestones might be enough

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Too Little Structure
```
Just: README.md

Result: Claude makes it up as it goes
```

### ❌ Too Much Structure
```
PRD.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
TECHNICAL_SPEC.md
INTERFACE_SPEC.md
API_SPEC.md  
DATA_SPEC.md
DEPLOYMENT_SPEC.md
...

Result: Nobody reads it, too much overhead
```

### ❌ Wrong Structure
```
Only: DEPLOYMENT.md + MONITORING.md

Result: No requirements, no architecture
```

## Conclusion

**For this Voice-to-Text project**:

✅ **Use**: SPECIFICATION + ARCHITECTURE + TASKS + CONTEXT  
❌ **Don't use**: PRD-only (too vague)  
❌ **Don't use**: Full spec-driven (overkill)  
⚠️ **Could add**: Skills/Superpowers as supplement  

**Why it works**:
- Right amount of detail for 4-6 hour project
- Gives Claude Code clear guardrails
- Maintains focus on F# + specific libraries
- Easy to resume
- Quality checkpoints built in

**Time investment**:
- Setup: 1 hour (creating these docs)
